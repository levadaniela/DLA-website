                <li><h3>My Childhood</h3></li>
                <p style="text-align: justify;">I was born in Republic of Moldova in November, 1989. A small country in Eastern Europe, but which is not part of EU. A colorful and warm country, but too small for big ambitious and dreamers.</p>
                <p>More about Moldova you can find <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moldova">here.</a></p>
                <li><h3>Studies</h3></li>
                <p style="text-align: justify;">Because of my desire for adventures, I applied for a scholarship to a well-known university in Romania.
                    I'm holding a Master’s degree in <b>Expertise and Quality Control of chemicals products, food and materials</b>; as well as a Bachelor degree in <b>Engineering and Management in Catering and Agrotourism</b>; attaining comprehensive knowledge of organic farming issues, resource management concerns, and sustainability practices.</p>
                <li><h3>Personal life</h3></li>
                <p style="text-align: justify;">I met my husband during student life. We are together for 10 years, and have a beautiful one year old daughter.</p>

            <h2 id="my-hoby">My Hobby</h2>
            <p style="text-align: justify;">Finding a new hobby is a funny and dificult one, it takes a real effort to actually go out and learn something. And it becomes even harder when you have a one year old toddler :) as it takes up so much time!
              Over the years I’ve always dabbled in the sewing and haberdashery world. I’m USELESS at any kind of art, I can’t draw, paint or sculpt. But I’ve always found a bit more joy in thread, wool and fabric. I like being able to create something which is tangible, which you can hold and actually physically give something.
            I started off with cross stitch. Which I always enjoyed as a little hobby, it’s rather therapeutic in terms of crossing off a pattern and doing lots of similar stitches. I did some more traditional ones and tried some different patterns and more modern styles.</p>
            <p style="text-align: justify;">Now I'm working on a new project : my own blousse, you may see my progress so far below:</p>
