But I’ve always found a bit more joy in thread, wool\r\n          and fabric. I like being able to create something which is tangible,\r\n          which you can hold and actually physically give something. I started\r\n          off with cross stitch. Which I always enjoyed as a little hobby, it’s\r\n          rather therapeutic in terms of crossing off a pattern and doing lots\r\n          of similar stitches.
